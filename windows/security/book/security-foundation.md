Microsoft is committed to continuously investing in improving the development process, building highly secure-by-design software, and addressing security compliance requirements. Security and privacy considerations informed by offensive research are built into each phase of our product design and software development process. Microsoft’s security foundation includes not only our development and certification processes, but also our end-to-end supply chain. The comprehensive Windows 11 security foundation also reflects our deep commitment to principles of security by design and security by default.
