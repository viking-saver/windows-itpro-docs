Operating systems face an onslaught of security threats, from malware and exploits to unauthorized access and privilege escalation. Windows 11 is the most secure Windows yet, with strong operating system safeguards to help keep devices, identities, and data safe. Defenses include a trusted boot process, layers of encryption, network security, and virus and threat protection. These comprehensive security features ensure that Windows 11 provides robust protection against modern cyber threats.
