Today's ever-evolving threats require strong alignment between hardware and software to keep users, data, and devices protected. The operating system and software alone can't defend against the wide range of tools used by cybercriminals to steal credentials, take data, and implant malware. In partnership with our silicon and device manufacturing partners, Windows 11 PCs shield software, hardware, and firmware with features like TPM 2.0, Microsoft Pluton, and Virtualization-based security. Windows 11 PCs provide hardware-backed protection by default to significantly improve security while maintaining the performance that users expect.
