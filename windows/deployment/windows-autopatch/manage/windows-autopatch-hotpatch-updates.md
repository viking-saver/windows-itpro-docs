# Hotpatch updates (public preview)

[!INCLUDE [windows-autopatch-applies-to-all-licenses](../includes/windows-autopatch-applies-to-all-licenses.md)]

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This feature is in public preview. It is being actively developed and might not be complete. They're made available on a "Preview" basis. You can test and use these features in production environments and scenarios and provide feedback.

Hotpatch updates are [Monthly B release security updates](/windows/deployment/update/release-cycle#monthly-security-update-release) that can be installed without requiring you to restart the device. Hotpatch updates are designed to reduce downtime and disruptions. By minimizing the need to restart, these updates help ensure faster compliance, making it easier for organizations to maintain security while keeping workflows uninterrupted.

## Key benefits

- Hotpatch updates streamline the installation process and enhance compliance efficiency.
- No changes are required to your existing update ring configurations. Your existing ring configurations are honored alongside Hotpatch policies.
- The [Hotpatch quality update report](../monitor/windows-autopatch-hotpatch-quality-update-report.md) provides a per policy level view of the current update statuses for all devices that receive Hotpatch updates.

## Eligible devices

To benefit from Hotpatch updates, devices must meet the following prerequisites:

- Operating System: Devices must be running Windows 11 24H2 or later.
- VBS (Virtualization-based security): VBS must be enabled to ensure secure installation of Hotpatch updates.
- Latest Baseline Release: Devices must be on the latest baseline release version to qualify for Hotpatch updates. Microsoft releases Baseline updates quarterly as standard cumulative updates. For more information on the latest schedule for these releases, see [Release notes for Hotpatch](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/release-notes-for-hotpatch-in-azure-automanage-for-windows-server-2022-4e234525-5bd5-4171-9886-b475dabe0ce8?preview=true).

## Ineligible devices

Devices that don't meet one or more prerequisites automatically receive the Latest Cumulative Update (LCU) instead. Latest Cumulative Update (LCU) contains monthly updates that supersede the previous month's updates containing both security and nonsecurity releases.  

LCUs requires you to restart the device, but the LCU ensures that the device remains fully secure and compliant.

> [!NOTE]
> If devices aren't eligible for Hotpatch updates, these devices are offered the LCU. The LCU keeps your configured Update ring settings, it doesn't change the settings.

## Release cycles

## Enroll devices to receive Hotpatch updates

> [!NOTE]
> If you're using Autopatch groups and want your devices to receive Hotpatch updates, you must create a Hotpatch policy and assign devices to it.  Turning on Hotpatch updates doesn't change the deferral setting applied to devices within an Autopatch group.

**To enroll devices to receive Hotpatch updates:**

1. Go to the [Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431).
1. Select **Devices** from the left navigation menu.
1. Under the **Manage updates** section, select **Windows updates**.
1. Go to the **Quality updates** tab.
1. Select **Create**, and select **Windows quality update policy (preview)**.
1. Under the **Basics** section, enter a name for your new policy and select Next.
1. Under the **Settings** section, set **"When available, apply without restarting the device ("hotpatch")** to **Allow**. Then, select **Next**.
1. Select the appropriate Scope tags or leave as Default and select **Next**.
1. Assign the devices to the policy and select **Next**.
1. Review the policy and select **Create**.

These steps ensure that targeted devices, which are [eligible](#eligible-devices) to receive Hotpatch updates, are configured properly. [Ineligible devices](#ineligible-devices) are offered the latest cumulative updates (LCU).

> [!NOTE]
> Turning on Hotpatch updates doesn't change the existing deadline-driven or scheduled install configurations on your managed devices.  Deferral and active hour settings will still apply.
