# Create Microsoft Connected Cache Azure resource and cache nodes

This article outlines how to create and configure your Microsoft Connected Cache for Enterprise and Education cache nodes. The creation and configuration of your cache node takes place in Azure. The deployment of your cache node requires downloading and running an OS-specific provisioning package on your host machine.

## Prerequisites

1. **Azure Pay-As-You-Go subscription**: Microsoft Connected Cache is a free-of-charge service hosted in Azure. You'll need a pay-as-you-go Azure subscription in order to onboard to our service. To create a subscription, go to [pay-as-you-go subscription page](https://azure.microsoft.com/offers/ms-azr-0003p/).
2. **Hardware to host Connected Cache**: The recommended configuration serves approximately 35,000 managed devices, downloading a 2-GB payload in 24-hour timeframe at a sustained rate of 6.5 Gbps.

For more information on sizing and OS requirements, see [the prerequisites for using Connected Cache](mcc-ent-prerequisites.md).


## Create Connected Cache Azure resource

# [Azure portal](#tab/portal)

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), select **Create a Resource** and search for `Microsoft Connected Cache for Enterprise and Education`.

This screenshot shows all of the fields you can choose to configure the cache node." lightbox="./images/mcc-isp-provision-cache-node-numbered.png":::  
-->

1. Select the Microsoft Connected Cache for Enterprise resource. When prompted, choose the subscription, resource group, and location for the resource. Then enter a name for the resource, then select Review + Create.

1. After a few moments, you'll see a "Validation successful" message, indicating you can move onto the next step and select Create.

1. The creation of the resource might take a few minutes. After a successful creation, you'll see a page stating the deployment is complete. Select **Go to resource** to create cache nodes.


# [Azure CLI](#tab/cli)

### Prerequisites

* An Azure CLI environment:

  * Use the Bash environment in [Azure Cloud Shell](/azure/cloud-shell/get-started/classic).

  * Or, if you prefer to run CLI reference commands locally, [install the Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)

    * Sign in to the Azure CLI by using the [az login](/cli/azure/reference-index#az-login) command.

    * Run [az version](/cli/azure/reference-index#az-version) to find the version and dependent libraries that are installed. To upgrade to the latest version, run [az upgrade](/cli/azure/reference-index#az-upgrade).

    * Install Azure CLI extension **mcc** by following the instructions [here](/cli/azure/azure-cli-extensions-overview#how-to-install-extensions).

    * Resource group under which a Connected Cache resource can be created. Use the [az group create](/cli/azure/group#az-group-create) command to create a new Resource group if you don't already have one.

#### Create Connected Cache Azure resource

Replace the following placeholders with your own information:
* *\<resource-group>*: Name of an existing resource group in your subscription.
* *\<mcc-resource-name>*: A name for your Microsoft Connected Cache for Enterprise resource.
* *\<location>*: The Azure region where your Microsoft Connected Cache will be located.

```azurecli-interactive
az mcc ent resource create --mcc-resource-name <mymccresource> --resource-group <myrg> --location <region>
```

## Create Connected Cache cache node

# [Azure portal](#tab/portal)

  1. Open Azure portal and navigate to the Microsoft Connected Cache for Enterprise resource that you created.<br>
  1. Under Cache Node Management, select **Cache Nodes** then **Create Cache Node**.<br>
  
  1. Provide a name for your cache node and select the host OS you plan to deploy the cache node on, then select **Create**. Note, cache node names have to be unique under the Microsoft Connected Cache resource.
  <!--
    :::image type="content" source="images/mcc-isp-provision-cache-node-numbered.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal depicting the cache node configuration page of a cache node. This screenshot shows all of the fields you can choose to configure the cache node." lightbox="./images/mcc-isp-provision-cache-node-numbered.png":::  
    -->
  The creation of the cache node might take a few minutes. Select **Refresh** to see your recently created cache node.
Once the cache node state changes to **Not Configured**, you can now configure your cache node.<br>
For more information about different cache node states, see [Cache node states](#cache-node-states).


# [Azure CLI](#tab/cli)

Use the following command to create a new cache node if you don't already have one.

Replace the following placeholders with your own information:
* *\<resource-group>*: Name of existing resource group in your subscription.
* *\<mcc-resource-name>*: Name of the Microsoft Connected Cache for Enterprise resource.
* *\<cache-node-name>*: A name for your Microsoft Connected Cache node.
* *\<host-os>*: The OS on which cache node will be provisioned.
  Accepted values: `windows`, `linux`

```azurecli-interactive
az mcc ent node create --cache-node-name <mycachenode> --mcc-resource-name <mymccresource> --resource-group <myrg> --host-os <linux>
```

<br>

>[!NOTE]
>To ensure cache node has been created successfully, run the following command before continuing with cache node configuration.
>```azurecli-interactive
>az mcc ent node show --cache-node-name <mycachenode> --mcc-resource-name <mymccresource> --resource-group <myrg>  
>```
>In the output look for **cacheNodeState**. If ***cacheNodeState = Not Configured***, you can continue with cache node configuration.
>If ***cacheNodeState = Registration in Progress***, then the cache node is still in process of being created. Wait a couple of minutes and run the command again.
>To know more about different cache node state, see [Cache node states](#cache-node-states).

### General configuration fields

| Field Name |Expected Value |Description|
|---|---|---|
|**Cache node name** | Alphanumeric string that contains no spaces| The name of the cache node. You may choose names based on location such as "Seattle-1". This name must be unique and can't be changed later |
|**Host OS** | Linux or Windows| This is the operating system of the host machine that the cache node will be deployed to.|

### Storage fields

##### Cache node for Linux

>[!Important]
>All cache drives must have full read/write permissions set or the cache node will not function. For example, in a terminal you can run: sudo chmod 777 /path/to/cachedrivefolder
<br>

| Field Name |Expected Value |Description|
|---|---|---|
|**Cache drive folder**| File path string |Up to nine drive folders accessible by the cache node can be configured for each cache node to configure cache storage. Enter the location of the folder in Ubuntu where the external physical drive is mounted. For example: /dev/sda3/. Each cache drive should have read/write permissions configured. Ensure your disks are mounted and visit Attach a data disk to a Linux VM for more information.|
|**Cache drive size in gigabytes**| Integer in GB| Set the size of each drive configured for the cache node. Minimum cache drive size is 50 GB.|

##### Cache node for Windows

| Field Name |Expected Value |Description|
|---|---|---|
|**Cache drive folder**| File path string /var/mcc| This is the folder path where content is cached. You can't change the folder path.|
|**Cache drive size in gigabytes**| Integer in GB| Set the size of each drive configured for the cache node. Minimum cache drive size is 50 GB. |

#### Proxy settings
<br>
You can choose to enable or disable proxy settings on your cache node. Proxy should be set to enabled if the cache node will need to pass through a network proxy to download content. The provided proxy will also be used during deployment of the Connected Cache node to your host machine.

<br>

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Enabling or disabling the proxy settings after your cache node has been deployed will require running the provisioning script on the host machine again. This will ensure that proxy changes are in effect on the cache node. 

| Field Name	|Expected Value	 |Description|
|---|---|---|
|**Proxy host name**|	String or number|	Proxy host name or address|
|**Proxy port**|	Integer|	Proxy port
